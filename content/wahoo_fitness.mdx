[Wahoo Fitness](https://wahoofitness.com) is a tech-fitness company that has created an ecosystem of sensors and devices for runners, cyclists, and fitness enthusiasts. I've had the pleasure of working on all software services including all the iOS / Android mobile apps, ELEMNT devices, and more recently helped bring SYSTM Training App from concept to market. My responsibilities vary between UX/UI, interaction design, design systems and front-end development.

Being fluent in both design and development allowed me to explore unchartered territories by [bridging code with design tools](https://medium.com/wahoo-product-design/blurring-the-lines-between-prototype-and-real-product-4687b624442d). It has also given me opportunities for me to speak at design conferences, meetups, and host workshops for external design teams. I actively encourage team mates to embrace code as a design tool.

- Lead the creation of DESIGNR, Wahoo Fitness' design system — serving SYSTM Training Program & Workout App.
- Developed [DESIGNR HELPR](https://github.com/aboutjax/designr-figma-plugin), an internal Figma plugin for improving the speed and accuracy of our design specs.
- Empowering, mentoring and developing other team members.
- Produce design wireframes and coding interactive prototypes for Wahoo Fitness apps on all platforms. The user experience work contributes to the success of Wahoo products. The Wahoo KICKR BIKE was regarded as the “biggest product launch” of Eurobike 2019, highly anticipated and reviewed by major cycling publications.
- Designed and set the foundation for the [product onboarding](https://medium.com/wahoo-product-design/new-on-wahoo-setup-wizard-b900f290c322) experience for Wahoo Fitness iOS / Android mobile apps. Worked closely with developers to ensure high standard software releases. The redesign was well received and instrumental for improving App Store ratings from 2.3 to 4.8 stars.
