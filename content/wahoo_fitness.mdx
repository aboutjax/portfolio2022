Worked on a number of different things including front end development, design systems,
and bringing ambiguous ideas to market. Fluency in both design and development allowed
me to explore unchartered territories – bridging code with design tools. My passion
for using code as a design tool allowed me to speak at design conferences, meetups
and host workshops for external design teams.

- Lead the work for design systems serving SYSTM Training Program & Workout App. Developed internal tools (Figma plugins) and processes to increase team productivity. Working pragmatically with stakeholders to bring the product to market in September 2021.

- Empowering, mentoring and developing other team members.

- Produce design wireframes and coding interactive prototypes for Wahoo Fitness apps on all platforms. The user experience work contributes to the success of Wahoo products. The Wahoo KICKR BIKE was regarded as the “biggest product launch” of Eurobike 2019, highly anticipated and reviewed by major cycling publications.

- Lead and iterate on an internal design system, assist in the product onboarding for Wahoo Fitness Apps. Worked closely with developers to ensure high standard software releases. The redesign was well received and instrumental for improving App Store ratings from 2.3 to 4.8 stars.
