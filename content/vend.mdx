I was involved with designing the point of sale on the iOS Register App. Tasks includes user research, user interviews, usability testing, interface & illustrations. View iOS Vend Register

## Product Animations

Screenshot recordings can be difficult to follow sometimes, so I put together some illustration animations to better demonstrate some of the compelling features Vend offers. Illustrated with Adobe Illustrator, and animated with Adobe After Effects.

## It's Fast

We reimagined the checkout process to save swipes, touches and keypad taps. Quicker sales mean more time making customers happy.

## Quickly Access Products

Access your most popular products faster, and create an intuitive interface using our custom Quick Keys. You can now access folders from the sell screen that hold their own Quick Keys within.

## Web Register

After collecting valuable feedback from our users, we knew we had to bring some of what we learnt from iOS Register back to the web, which has largely remained unchanged since the beginning. The old web point of sale was also showing signs of technical debt which hindered on development time for new features. It was time for a rewrite. It was time for a redesign. Read more about the design process.

## Prototypes

Below are some of the design explorations while at Vend.
