Vend is New Zealand’s leading retail POS software, inventory management, ecommerce & customer loyalty for iPad, Mac and PC. Easily manage & grow your business in the cloud.

I assisted with designing the point of sale on the iOS Register App. Tasks includes user research, user interviews, usability testing, interface & illustrations.

We brought everything we've learnt from iOS Register to the web, which has largely remained unchanged since the beginning. The technical debt in the old web point-of-sale hindered on development time for new features. [Read more about the design process](https://medium.com/we-build-vend/the-inside-scoop-designing-vend-s-new-point-of-sale-3e392f12955) if you're into it.
