[Koordinates](https://koordinates.com) is designed and engineered for all data users—and not just those with technical expertise. With your own data service, you can realize the true potential of your geospatial data.

> Koordinates is a geospatial data management platform inspired by cracking GIS data out of vendor silos. You can host, manage, share, publish, access, and build apps, alongside tens of thousands of others.

During my time at Koordinates from April 2016 – April 2018, I worked with the rest of the design team on a major re-design and front-end development of the marketing site. We used various design tools from wireframing to interactive prototypes to ensure that what we're building makes sense for our users.

The spatial industry has proven to be a fascinating field to work in because it directly impacts our lives and the world we live in. However, spatial professionals often spend far too much time and resource sourcing relevant data for their projects. The data that is available is often hard to search, appraise and use, despite the effort and resource invested in making it open in the first place.

That was where Koordinates comes in. It was a rewarding experience working at Koordinates. It was amazing to work with the talented bunch, all striving towards the same mission: To make it easier for everyone to find, share and use our planet’s authoritative geospatial data.
