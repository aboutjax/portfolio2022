[Figma Grids Generator](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/841313026689642442) is a Figma plugin I built in 2020. It was born from the frustration that I couldn't apply multiple grid styles on the same frame. The plugin allowed users to quickly apply pre-canned 4pt spacing, max-width and 12 columns grid styles on any frame.

It filled a much desired gap in Figma's layout grids capabilities. Since 2020, it has grown pretty popular in the plugin community. At the time of writing this, the plugin was used by more than 11,000 users.
