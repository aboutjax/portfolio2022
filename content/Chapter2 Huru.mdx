In April 2022 I started learning how to model 3D objects with Blender. I used my road bike as the subject. Each part was modeled manually with various techniques I learnt from [Blender Guru](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoXOplUvAw). Surprisingly, the Ultegra r8000 Crankset was the hardest part to model, but I was pretty stoked with the result.
