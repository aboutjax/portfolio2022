[Gonerding.co](https://goneriding.co) is a cycling journal built with Next.js, MDX, Strava API, Mapbox GL JS. [Github Repo](https://github.com/aboutjax/goneriding-next). This project was inspired by my year-long bike travel in 2019. I was looking for a blogging platform that focused on storytelling through a GPX or .fit file. I couldn't find one that matched what I had in mind so I built one. Goneriding served as a personal journal to document all the notable rides I've done that year.
